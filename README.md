     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

FitFindr is an agent that takes a request like "a vintage graphic tee under $30, size M", searches listings, works out what the item would go with, and writes a caption for it. 

If a user asks 'a vintage graphic tee under $30, size M', then they get back outfits that'd go well with the request. It also gives stylist tips and a caption for it!
<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Search the listings data for items matching a description, and optionally a size and a price ceiling.
- **Inputs:** `description` (str), `size` (str or None), `max_price` (float or None) <!-- name and type each: `max_price` (float), not "a price" -->
- **Returns:** a list of matching dicts, best match first. Each listing dicts has these fields: id, title, description, category, style_tags (list), size,
        condition, price (float), colors (list), brand (str or None), platform
- **When it has nothing:** an empty list

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Given a thrifted item and the user's wardrobe, suggest one or two outfits.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dict), `wardrobe` (dict)
- **Returns:** A non-empty string with outfit suggestions.
- **When it has nothing:** return general styling advice

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Write a short caption someone would actually post about the find.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (str), `new_item` (dict)
- **Returns:** A two-to-four sentence caption.
- **When it has nothing:** return a descriptive message

---

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session and stop. Otherwise, take the first result and go to suggest_outfit.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** regex <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which --> 

**What moves through the session:** selected_item, outfit_suggestion, fit_card <!-- which fields, in what order -->

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30'

[1] parse_query
      in:  vintage graphic tee under $30
      out: dict with keys: description, size, max_price
[2] search_listings (via MCP)
      in:  dict with keys: description, size, max_price
      out: 10 items: Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print, Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style, Vintage Band Tee — Faded Grey … +7 more
      →    10 match(es)

  Found:    Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print — $18.0 on depop

  Outfit:   Hey babe! Grab that baby tee—it's an absolute Y2K steal for $18. Here are two ways you can style it using pieces already hanging in your closet:

**Outfit 1: Ultimate Y2K Streetwear**
*   **Top:** Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print
*   **Bottoms:** Baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash
*   **Outerwear:** Vintage black denim jacket 
*   **Shoes:** Chunky white sneakers
*   **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag

*Stylist Tip:* The fitted, cropped cut of the baby tee balances the volume of your baggy dark wash jeans perfectly. Throw on the vintage black denim jacket and chunky white sneakers to lean fully into that nostalgic turn-of-the-millennium look.

**Outfit 2: Casual Crossover**
*   **Top:** Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print
*   **Bottoms:** Wide-leg khaki trousers
*   **Accessories:** Brown leather belt, Black crossbody bag
*   **Shoes:** Black combat boots

*Stylist Tip:* Mix the Y2K butterfly graphic with the relaxed, minimal vibe of your wide-leg khaki trousers. Cinch the trousers with the brown leather belt, and finish with the black combat boots to add a little bit of edge to the pastel pink and purple tones. 

Both looks are super easy, practical, and let that $18 baby tee shine!

  Fit card: Scored this Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print on depop for $18.00 and I'm honestly never taking it off. It gives major turn-of-the-millennium nostalgia whether I pair it with baggy dark wash denim or my favorite wide-leg trousers.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:* I asked for implementations of search_listings, suggest_outfits and create_fit_card
- *What came back:*: I got good implementations for them, but it assumed some things like the structure of the dict. I gave it extra context and the implementation worked well.
- *What I changed:* I removed some unnecessary comments and reviewed through the code.

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:* I asked it to review my acceptance criteria
- *What came back:* It gave me some suggestions like the target for criteria 2 doesn't say why 5 of 5 should work and not 4 of 5
- *What I changed:* I left it as it since I was running out of time

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**



---

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
